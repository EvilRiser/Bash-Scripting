script is a list of commands interpreted by a script language
commands that can be entered interactively or listed in a text file
scripting langauge are interpreted at runtime
slower to run but fast to develop

shell script --> it is a executable text file with an interpreter directive
#!interpreter [optional-arg]
'interpreter' --> path to an executable program
'optional-arg' --> single argument string

$$shell directive
pound bang slash bin slash shell
#!/bin/sh
#!/bin/bash

$$ python script directive

#!/usr/bin/env python3

$$ example shell script
create the shell script
	-> touch hello_world.sh
	-> echo '#!/bin/bash' >> hello_world.sh
	-> echo 'hello world' >> hello_world.sh
to run your bash script you have to make it executable
check the options
-> ls -l hello_world.sh
-> chmod +x hello_world.sh
run your bash script
-> ./hello_world.sh

It begins with a 'shebang' script directive
It is used to run commands and programs
scripting language are interpreted not compiled

greet.sh
	echo -n "Enter firstname:"
	read fname
	echo -n "enter lastname:"
	read lname
	echo "hello $fname $lname"
->bash greet.sh

greetnew.sh
	#! /bin/bash
	echo -n "Enter firstname:"
	read fname
	echo -n "enter lastname:"
	read lname
	echo "hello $fname $lname"

makeit executable
chmod u+x greetnew.sh
-> ./greetnew.sh
